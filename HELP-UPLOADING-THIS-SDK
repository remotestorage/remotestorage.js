If you have apache and php installed on your server, you will see 'It works!' on your domain when you browse to it. If you're at this stage, then ssh to your server and do the following:

	a2dissite default

Disabling the default site should not be necessary, but I've found that it is. Now point a domain name (sub-domains are OK) to the server, which will be the domain of your unhosted web app, and put the contents of this tar ball on your server as a directory under the web root, owned by www-data. For instance like this (when ssh'ed into your server as root):

	wget --no-check-certificate -qO- https://github.com/unhosted/unhosted/tarball/master | tar -xz
	cd unhosted-unhosted-*
	mv my-unhosted-website /var/www
	chown -R www-data /var/www/my-unhosted-website

If you want to use this in production, then you should install an SSL certificate. The easiest way is through www.startssl.com. It's free of charge (does not cost any money) and works in all browsers. Startssl will give you three files, which you should store as:

	/root/ssl.crt
	/root/ssl.key
	/root/sub.class1.server.ca.pem

While your cert is being requested at startssl, you can continue configuring your server.
Edit lines 2, 3, 16 and 17 of apache2.conf to replace [www.]'example.com' with your own domain name.

Now configure apache (if you want to try it without SSL first, skip the 'a2enmod ssl' line):

	mv apache2.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/my-unhosted-website
	a2ensite my-unhosted-website
	a2enmod dav_fs
	a2enmod headers
	a2enmod ssl
	/etc/init.d/apache2 restart

After that, open the website in your browser and follow instructions from there.
