0.8.0
=====
* Overview:
  * Rewritten: RemoteStorage, WireClient, BaseClient, Sync, IndexedDB
  * Supports the three latest spec versions:
    - 2012.04 (http://www.w3.org/community/unhosted/wiki/RemoteStorage-2012.04)
    - remotestorage-00 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dejong-remotestorage-00)
    - remotestorage-01 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dejong-remotestorage-01)
  * The default cache backend changed to indexedDB
  * Modularized build (build/components.json lists groups and their dependencies)
  * Removed internal use of AMD. Everything is nested below the global RemoteStorage namespace now.
  * Added 'inspect' debug widget. If debug support is built in, use remoteStorage.inspect() in your app to try it.

* Changes to the API:
  * Global 'remoteStorage' object is now an instance of RemoteStorage
  * Caching & Access settings are persisted and survive a redirect
  * remoteStorage.claimAccess no longer returns a promise (was deprecated in 0.7.1)
  * BaseClient#use/BaseClient#release are deprecated in favor of BaseClient#cache
  * Added BaseClient#scope() to get BaseClient instances of paths nested below the module root.
  * Made validation schemas global (schemas from other modules can be referred to using: <module-name>/<type-alias>)
  * Added 'inspect' debug widget. If debug support is built in, use remoteStorage.inspect() in your app to try it.
  * Deprectated the "util" part. It contained a lot of utility functions that bloated the library and are also
    available in the same or similar form from third-party libraries.
    Until the next major release a subset of the "util" object will still be available (see "src/legacy.js" for
    a list of methods that are included).
