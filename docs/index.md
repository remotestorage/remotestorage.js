# remoteStorage.js

Welcome to the remoteStorage.js documentation!

remoteStorage.js is a JavaScript/TypeScript library for storing user data
locally in the browser, as well as connecting to [remoteStorage](/) servers and
syncing data across devices and applications. It is also capable of connecting
and syncing data with a person\'s Dropbox, Google Drive, or Solid account (optional).

> [!NOTE]
> For brevity\'s sake, we will also use the short name **rs.js** across these docs.

See [Why use this?](why) if you just learned about remoteStorage, or head to
[Getting started](getting-started/) to jump right in.
