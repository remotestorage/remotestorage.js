remoteStorage.js is a JavaScript library for storing user data locally in the
browser, as well as connecting to [remoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io)
servers and syncing data across devices and applications. It is also capable of
connecting and syncing data with a person's Dropbox or Google Drive account
(optional).

The library is well-tested and actively maintained. It is safe to use in
production.

### Running a local test server

To develop remoteStorage-enabled apps, you need to have a
remoteStorage-compatible storage account. We recommend
[php-remote-storage](https://github.com/fkooman/php-remote-storage) (PHP), or
[armadietto](https://github.com/remotestorage/armadietto) (node.js), or
[mysteryshack](https://github.com/untitaker/mysteryshack) (Rust) for running a
local test server, or for self-hosting an RS server.

You can also get an account with a hoster, or use another
remoteStorage server implementation: [Servers](https://wiki.remotestorage.io/Servers).

### Developing, Contributing

remoteStorage.js is a grassroots project, developed by the community, for the
community. We'd be happy to count you among the many [people who
contributed](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/graphs/contributors)
to the project so far!

Read our [Contributing docs](https://remotestoragejs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)
to get started.

### Versioning

We adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). This means that
breaking changes will result in a new major version. With npm, you can make
sure to only automatically upgrade to API-compatible versions by using either
the `^` prefix, or `x` as indicator for flexible numbers:

```js
"devDependencies": {
  "remotestoragejs": "1.x" // same as "^1.0.0"
}
```
