remoteStorage.js is a JavaScript library for storing user data locally in the
browser, as well as connecting to [remoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io)
servers and syncing data across devices and applications.

### Where to get help?

* See [remotestorage.io](http://remotestorage.io/) for general information about remoteStorage
* Follow the [remoteStorage.js Beginners Guide](https://wiki.remotestorage.io/RemoteStorage.js:Beginners'_Guide) to get started
* Read detailed library documentation in the [remoteStorage.js API docs](https://remotestorage.github.io/remotestorage.js)
* Ask questions on the [community forums](https://community.remotestorage.io/)
* Get instant support via IRC in [#remotestorage on Freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net:7000/remotestorage)

### Running a local test server

To develop remoteStorage-enabled apps, you need to have a
remoteStorage-compatible storage account. We recommend
[php-remote-storage](https://github.com/fkooman/php-remote-storage) (PHP) or
[mysteryshack](https://github.com/untitaker/mysteryshack) (Rust)
for running a local test server.

You can also get an account with a hoster, or use one of the various other
remoteStorage server implementations:
[Servers](https://wiki.remotestorage.io/Servers).

### Which version to choose?

You can either use a stable release or the current HEAD build. Stable releases
can be found in [release/](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/tree/master/release/).
Directories with a `-rcX` suffix contain release candidates, which may be used
for testing but aren't necessarily "stable" releases.

[release/head](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/tree/master/release/head/)
contains a semi-current HEAD build. It is updated manually and irregularly. To
build an up-to-date version of all files, run `npm run build` in the repository
root.

## Usage
[TODO]

### Node

    $ npm install remotestoragejs

See our [node.js documentation](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/blob/master/doc/nodejs.md) for more details.

### Running tests

Install development dependencies including the
[testing framework](https://github.com/silverbucket/jaribu):

    $ npm install

Run all tests:

    $ npm test

Note: deliberate exceptions may look like errors, but if it says "all
tests passed" under the test output all is well for that test.

Use the `jaribu` executable in order to test single files, like so e.g.:

    $ node_modules/.bin/jaribu test/unit/baseclient-suite.js

### How to build

Make sure you have [Natural Docs](http://www.naturaldocs.org/) installed on
your system (e.g. via `sudo apt-get install naturaldocs`).

Display the available build tasks:

    $ make

Build everything:

    $ make all
