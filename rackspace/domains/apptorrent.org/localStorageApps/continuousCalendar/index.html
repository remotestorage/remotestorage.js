	<meta name="description" content="Continuous Calendar is a simple web calendar. New weeks are added at the top and bottom when you scroll, so the page is essentially infinite. This is much faster and easier to use than the standard day/week/month model. Adding notes is super easy too, just click and type. Perfect for little reminders like on a real wall calendar. It's still very experimental at this point. It only it works on the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Data is stored using the new localStorage object from the HTML5 specification, which means it is completely private. Everything you enter will only be saved in your current browser on your computer, and will never be sent anywhere. The source is released under the MIT License." />
