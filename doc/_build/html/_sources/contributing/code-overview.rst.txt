Code overview
=============

The code of remotestorage.js consists of files in the ``src/`` folder of
this repo. It is built with webpack in the ``build/`` folder of this
repo. The tests are in the ``test/`` folder.

The structure of the code is based around feature loading. Most files in
``src/`` correspond to a feature, e.g. ``RemoteStorage.Discover`` or
``RemoteStorage.Caching``.

The feature loading happens synchronously during the page load in
``src/remotestorage.js`` (just including the script in your app will
lead to executing the code that loads the features).

Most feature load under their own name, but for ``remoteStorage.local``
a choice is made between ``RemoteStorage.IndexedDB``,
``RemoteStorage.LocalStorage`` and ``RemoteStorage.InMemoryCaching``.

For ``remoteStorage.local`` we then also have a `special
mixin <https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/issues/777#issuecomment-57392440>`__
called ``src/cachinglayer.js``, which mixes in some common functions
into the object.

The ``remoteStorage.remote`` feature is not loaded immediately, but only
when ``RemoteStorage.Discover`` calls ``remoteStorage.setBackend``, and
then a choice is made between ``RemoteStorage.WireClient``,
``RemoteStorage.GoogleDrive``, ``RemoteStorage.Dropbox``, etcetera (we
aim to add more backends in the future).
