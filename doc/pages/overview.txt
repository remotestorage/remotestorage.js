File: Overview

Welcome to the developer documentation for remoteStorage.js, a client side implementation of the <remoteStorage at http://remotestorage.io/> specification.

What is remoteStorage?:

remoteStorage.js is a JavaScript library, used to enable users of <unhosted at http://unhosted.org/> web apps (JavaScript apps running in a browser) to store their data at a place of their choice (their "remoteStorage" server). It tries to get in the way of app developers as little as possible, while providing the easiest path for both developers and users to integrate their storage with apps.

Some of the goals of remoteStorage.js are:
* Provide a unified "login" experience across apps through the "connect widget".
* Encourage apps to share common data models, through "modules", which can be shared between apps and even be distributed with remoteStorage.js
* Transparently cache data locally, to make offline-usage of apps as easy as possible.

Where to start reading?:

* If you are an app developer, all you ever need to use is in the "Public API" section. Start reading about the toplevel module <remoteStorage>.
* If you want to fix bugs or get involved in development of remoteStorage.js itself, you can dig around the "Internals".

Where to get help?:

* Join our IRC channel #remotestorage on <freenode at https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=remotestorage>
* We use Github Issues for discussion, join us in the <remotestorage.io repository https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.io/issues>
