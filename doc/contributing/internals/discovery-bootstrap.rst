How connecting to a storage works internally
============================================

When the RemoteStorage instance is instantiated, it checks the fragment
of the URL to see if it contains an ``access_token`` or
``remotestorage`` parameter. In the first case, the access token is
given to the remote using ``remoteStorage.remote.configure()``. In the
second case, WebFinger discovery is triggered for the user address given
(see `storage-first section`_ of the remoteStorage spec).

The user can also set the user address through the widget, or the app
can call ``remoteStorage.remote.configure({userAddress:
'user@host.com'})`` to set the user address.

When a user address is set, but no other remote parameters are known
yet, WebFinger discovery will be triggered. From the WebFinger response,
the library extract the storage base URL, the storage API, and the OAuth
dialog URL.

If no OAuth URL is given, Implied Auth is triggered:
https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/issues/782

If an OAuth URL is known, but no token yet, the OAuth dance will be
started by setting the ``location.href`` of the window, redirecting
the user to that URL. When the dance comes back, the library will detect
the ``access_token`` from the window location during the page load, and
from that point onwards, the remote is connected.
