This library is primarily meant for use in unhosted web apps,
but we also provide a [node build](), which you can use with
nodejs.

Documentation for this is still missing, and we
[don't have an example app for it yet](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/issues/768)
but there are some
pointers [in github comments](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/pull/781#issuecomment-57721011)
