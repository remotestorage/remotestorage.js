This library is primarily meant for use in unhosted web apps,
but you can also use it with nodejs. The way to do this is
currently in flux, and will change when we tag and publish
the next release, so then this document will also be updated.

Documentation for this is still missing, and we
[don't have an example app for it yet](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/issues/768)
but there are some
pointers [in github comments](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/pull/781#issuecomment-57721011)
