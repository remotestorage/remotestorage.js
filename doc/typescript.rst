Usage with TypeScript
=====================

Since version ``2.0.0``, the source code of rs.js itself has been ported to
TypeScript, and release builds now ship with generated type definitions. Thus,
there is no extra type definitions package to import/require, and everything
should just work out of the box.

.. NOTE::

  There's still a lot of room for improvement in our TypeScript usage. If
  you're experienced with TypeScript, and interested in contributing to rs.js,
  your help in this area would be most appreciated.
