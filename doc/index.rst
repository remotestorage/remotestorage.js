remoteStorage.js
================

Welcome to the remoteStorage.js documentation!

remoteStorage.js is a JavaScript library for storing user data locally in the
browser, as well as connecting to `remoteStorage <http://remotestorage.io>`_
servers and syncing data across devices and applications. It is also capable of
connecting and syncing data with a person's Dropbox or Google Drive account
(optional).

.. NOTE::
  For brevity's sake, we will also use the short name rs.js across these docs.
