## 0.10.0 (June 2014)

This release contains a major rewrite of the tree-based sync and caching
system. Old cached data will be converted to the new format automatically.

### Breaking changes

* `getAll` and `getListing` now return an empty object instead of undefined when no items
    match the query
* Object meta data has been removed from the `getListing` response, until we have a better
    implementation (#652, #720, #721)
* `disconnect` event removed in favor of `disconnected`
* `remoteStorage.claimAccess` removed in favor of `remoteStorage.access.claim`
* `BaseClient#use` and `BaseClient#release` removed in favor of `BaseClient#cache`
* Change events with origin 'window' are now disabled by default
* The config variable `RemoteStorage._log` was renamed to `RemoteStorage.config.logging`

### New features

* Major rewrite of the tree-based sync and caching system
* Performance was improved, especially when storing many small objects
* A new `maxAge` parameter is available in the various BaseClient get...
    functions, where you can specify the maximum age of cached results (in ms).
    This replaces the ready-queue from 0.9.0.
* Caching of subtrees can now be configured as 'ALL', 'SEEN', or 'FLUSH'. The second
    one means documents that were seen once, will stay synced. Check the
    [caching documentation](http://remotestorage.io/doc/code/files/caching-js.html)
    for details. `caching.enable(path)` will use 'ALL' by default.
* Add and use background sync interval, based on Page Visibility API (#462)
* Choose from which origins change events are emitted via `RemoteStorage.config.changeEvents`
* More unit tests
* A 'local-events-done' event is emitted by `remoteStorage.local` after all events with origin 'local' have been emitted on page load.

### Experimental features

* Google Drive is now supported as an experimental backend
* Dropbox is now supported as an experimental backend
* Support for browser implied authentication
* With `remoteStorage.displayWidget({encryption: true})`, the user will be invited to enter a secret (password) into the widget, which the app can then use for client-side encryption.

### Bugfixes

* Fix private browsing mode in Firefox
* Handle 404s for directory GETs (#573)
* Always quote If-None-Match headers (#584)

## 0.8.1 (August 2013)

* Update the example server
* Fix edge case in sync with incoming deletions of entire directories

## 0.8.0 (August 2013)

### Overview:

* Rewritten: RemoteStorage, WireClient, BaseClient, Sync, IndexedDB
* Supports the three latest spec versions:
  - 2012.04 (http://www.w3.org/community/unhosted/wiki/RemoteStorage-2012.04)
  - remotestorage-00 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dejong-remotestorage-00)
  - remotestorage-01 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dejong-remotestorage-01)
* The default cache backend changed to indexedDB
* Modularized build (build/components.json lists groups and their dependencies)
* Removed internal use of AMD. Everything is nested below the global RemoteStorage namespace now.
* Added 'inspect' debug widget. If debug support is built in, use remoteStorage.inspect() in your app to try it.

### Changes to the API:

* Global 'remoteStorage' object is now an instance of RemoteStorage
* Caching & Access settings are persisted and survive a redirect
* remoteStorage.claimAccess no longer returns a promise (was deprecated in 0.7.1)
* BaseClient#use/BaseClient#release are deprecated in favor of BaseClient#cache
* Added BaseClient#scope() to get BaseClient instances of paths nested below the module root.
* Made validation schemas global (schemas from other modules can be referred to using: <module-name>/<type-alias>)
* Added 'inspect' debug widget. If debug support is built in, use remoteStorage.inspect() in your app to try it.
* Deprectated the "util" part. It contained a lot of utility functions that bloated the library and are also
    available in the same or similar form from third-party libraries.
    Until the next major release a subset of the "util" object will still be available (see "src/legacy.js" for
    a list of methods that are included).
