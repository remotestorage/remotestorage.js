    After the 0.7.0 release we introduced a simpler way to call
    remoteStorage.displayWidget(), so this example became even simpler.
    Please pick which version of the library you would like to see the
    minimal app example for:
    <ul>
      <li>Version <a href="../minimal-0.7.0/">0.7.0</a></li>
      <li>Version <a href="../minimal-head/">head</a></li>
    </ul>
